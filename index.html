<p>Wisdom Improvement Proposals (WIPs) describe standards for the Wisdom platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>First review <a href="WIPS/wip-1">WIP-1</a>. Then clone the repository and add your WIP to it. There is a <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-X.md">template WIP here</a>. Then submit a Pull Request to Wisdom's <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs">WIPs repository</a>.</p>

<h2>WIP status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - an WIP that is open for consideration.</li>
  <li><strong>Accepted</strong> - an WIP that is planned for immediate adoption, i.e. expected to be included in the next hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer WIPs).</li>
  <li><strong>WIP</strong> - an WIP that What means???</li>
  <li><strong>Final</strong> - an WIP that has been adopted in a previous hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer WIPs).</li>
  <li><strong>Deferred</strong> an WIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>WIP Types</h2>

<p>WIPs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of WIPs.</p>

<h3>Standard Track ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes any change that affects most or all Wisdom implementations, such as a change to the the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Ethereum. Furthermore Standard WIPs can be broken down into the following categories.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"core"|relative_url}}">Core</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Core"|size}})</h4>
<p>Improvements requiring a consensus fork, as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to “core dev” discussions.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"consensus"|relative_url}}">Consensus</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Consensus"|size}})</h4>

<h4><a href="{{"crypto"|relative_url}}">Crypto</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Crypto"|size}})</h4>

<h4><a href="{{"networking"|relative_url}}">Networking</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Networking"|size}})</h4>
<p>Includes improvements around devp2p and Light Ethereum Subprotocol, as well as proposed improvements to network protocol specifications of whisper and swarm.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"wrc"|relative_url}}">WRC</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","WRC"|size}})</h4>
<p>Application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, name registries, URI schemes, library/package formats, and wallet formats.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"interface"|relative_url}}">Interface</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Interface"|size}})</h4>
<p>Includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names and contract ABIs. The label “interface” aligns with the interfaces repo and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before an WIP is submitted to the WIPs repository.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"meta"|relative_url}}">Meta</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Meta"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes a process surrounding Ethereum or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process WIPs are like Standards Track WIPs but apply to areas other than the Ethereum protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Ethereum's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational WIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Ethereum development. Any meta-WIP is also considered a Process WIP.</p>
